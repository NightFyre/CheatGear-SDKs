# CheatGear-SDKs

I'm not waiting 7 days to use a product I pay for. I have been a patron member and also donated via paypal. This is very scummy way to treat an honest customer. The sad part is I even told Corrm that CheatGear would not work on VirtualMachine as I was trying to dump something that may not have been safe on my main machine. Never was it made aware to me that this changed my hwid and even so , whats stopping anybody from doing exactly what I am doing now? I can ask any of my friends to dump a game for me just the same way I could press the dump button if I was not getting hwid errors. 

Really weird hill to die on. The way you treated me is shitty at best. I've held my tongue on most of your other behaviors but this was my last straw.
